Intelligent, Remote-Controlled Home Protection System

As our society gets increasingly mobile, it is becoming commonplace 
for residences to remain vacant for a significant amount of time 
every day. Unfortunately, emergencies can occur during those time, 
which may require immediate mitigatory action.  This project 
proposes an approach that allows the resident to be notified of such 
emergencies and to perform mitigatory actions, even when she is 
hundreds of miles away. Our infrastructure includes three components: 
(1) programmable sensor devices to detect emergency situations; 
(2) a Web service hosted in the residentâ€™s home computer to send 
a notification to the smartphone of the user; and 
(3) a smartphone app that communicates with this Web service to notify 
the user, and provides a interface for the user to perform any 
mitigatory action. 
We develop a prototype system for detecting fire and intrusion 
emergencies. Our prototype system uses two sunSPOTs as sensors, 
an iRobot Create R as a mitigatory device, an Android app for 
user notification.
